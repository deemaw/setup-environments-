# STEP 1: GET KAFKA
Download the latest Kafka release and extract it:

$ tar -xzf kafka_2.13-2.7.0.tgz
$ cd kafka_2.13-2.7.0

# STEP 2: START THE KAFKA ENVIRONMENT
NOTE: Your local environment must have Java 8+ installed.

Run the following commands in order to start all services in the correct order:

# Start the ZooKeeper service
# Note: Soon, ZooKeeper will no longer be required by Apache Kafka.
$ bin/zookeeper-server-start.sh config/zookeeper.properties
Open another terminal session and run:

# Start the Kafka broker service
$ bin/kafka-server-start.sh config/server.properties

# STEP 3: CREATE A TOPIC TO STORE YOUR EVENTS

$ bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --topic quickstart-events --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

$ bin/kafka-topics.sh --describe --topic quickstart-events --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

# STEP 4: WRITE SOME EVENTS INTO THE TOPIC

$ bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --topic quickstart-events --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

# STEP 5: READ THE EVENTS

$ bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --topic quickstart-events --from-beginning --bootstrap-server localhost:9092

# STEP 6: TERMINATE THE KAFKA ENVIRONMENT
Now that you reached the end of the quickstart, feel free to tear down the Kafka environmentâ€”or continue playing around.

Stop the producer and consumer clients with Ctrl-C, if you haven't done so already.
Stop the Kafka broker with Ctrl-C.
Lastly, stop the ZooKeeper server with Ctrl-C.
If you also want to delete any data of your local Kafka environment including any events you have created along the way, run the command:

$ rm -rf /tmp/kafka-logs /tmp/zookeeper
